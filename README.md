Description
This project provides a client-side solution for geolocation services using the Google Maps API. The app allows users to perform the following tasks:

Obtain location data from an address: Given a postal address, the app retrieves the location data (latitude, longitude) and displays it on a map.

Calculate distances and travel times: The app calculates the distance and estimated travel time between two locations using different modes of transportation (walking, driving, public transport, etc.).

Store queries: All queries (address lookups and route calculations) are logged in a local database or log file for future reference.

The app is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the front-end and integrates with the Google Maps API for geolocation and map visualization.

Prerequisites
To use this app, you need a valid API key from Google. You can obtain it by following these steps:

Go to Google Maps Platform.
Register for an API key.
Replace the placeholder in the project code with your actual API key.
Installation
Clone or download this repository.
Open the project folder in your preferred code editor.
Make sure to replace the placeholder API key in the script with your own valid API key from Google.
Open index.html in your browser to view and interact with the app.
